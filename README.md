 # BlockChain Project
**Project Description:**

This is a project of BlochChain concepts.In this project we will supply 1 million tokens with eighteen decimal places per token from our metamask account to ten different accounts. we have used our contract address, our metamask account,metamask private key, and infura id in dotenv file to proceed. 


**My Main MetaMask Account:**
M_A = 0x31F817102A2Ad828a0f69E18E9424FEd10eABCD1

**My Private Key:**
P_k = 5ee5cd3c673e4a5496f42b8090ca11a193f89b16ac3a2009e8db3212d3dddc8e.

**Infura Id:**
I_I = b16cad6dc768480e95b8045ced2eac7e

**Contract Address:**
C_A = 0xCD636c4d1F87345DEa1470Cc34596351a42D0E87

we have updated all these things in our dotenv file so that we will get our required result.

**Tools**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
* [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

we will install node.js latest version for our application in order to transfer our required amount of tokens. we will use remix to run our solidity code and then we will get our contract address that we will use in this project. we will use our metamask account and private id.In etherscan we can see all our transactions.

**Files need to install**

1- Dotenv 

2- Ethereumjs-tx

3- Big-number

For our code to run successfully we need to install these files . we need to install dotenv, big-number,web3 and ethereumjs-tx otherwise we will get error for module not found etc. So we will run cammand (`npm i fs big-number dotenv web3 ethereumjs-tx`) then we will get node-module, package-lock.jason,package.json without these we will not be able to get our required result.Once we installed these files then we need to run node application by using cammand (`node distribute.js`). By running the command we are calling for node js application to distribute our tokens equally to all the ten accounts that are in account.txt file.

**Token Transfered:**

when you will do all the procedure above then you will see your token is successfully transfered to all the ten accounts equally.
